# mms-report

This utility is to create an easily shareable HTML view of the
contents of the mms database from an Android device.

This utility makes a lot of assumptions and will not work for all
versions of the Android operating system or messaging utilities.

Additionally, some assumptions are made about the form of telephone
numbers. Users outside of the United States may need to modify the
code to work with their telephone number formats.
